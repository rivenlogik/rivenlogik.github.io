&lt;p&gt;I really need to get around to typing up some notes I want to digitize from some recent events.  Particularly, beer making and homelab crap.  Time, truly the most precious commodity.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this weekend!   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just had to post something quick about a new band I found named Junius.&lt;br&gt;
I subscribe to &lt;a href="https://www.decibelmagazine.com"&gt;Decibel&lt;/a&gt;, which I recommend for anyone who has moved beyond the glory days that consisted
of massive amounts of free time and very little responsibility.  Those days are behind me now for sure, and Decibel is my go-to for keeping up with the metal scene 
other than a key friend who is still living his glory days.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decibel had a review for the new Junius album &lt;em&gt;Eternal Rituals for the Accretion of Light&lt;/em&gt;.  I believe they gave it a 8 or 9 out of 10. The album is so damn good and 
it's basically been on repeat for me the last month or so.  Highly recommend you click &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv_yKPChhq4"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and check out the song &lt;em&gt;Mass for Metaphysicians&lt;/em&gt;. 
The theme throughout the album regarding the path to transcendence only adds to the enjoyment of the music itself.  I think this will be one of my top 2017 albums for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="img" src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1160145689_16.jpg" title="Eternal Rituals"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a stab at the lyrics to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpSsLb59B1o"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Sarcophagus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; below which ends the album (probably my favorite track) and speaks to the existentialism tone throughout the album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lyrical content makes me think of Fear Factory or Meshuggah's brand of constantly improving thyself.  Where as Fear Factory and Meshuggah go the route of a more cyborg-like reconstruction to the self in order to improve, Junius speaks more to spiriual transcendence by stepping beyond the physical realm.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Seal the room
Light the fire
Burning clothes
The energy starts to flow

I am what I&amp;#39;ve learned
I meditate
My body shakes
The room starts to glow

Pouring over me
Higher frequencies
The final hour of the pain I&amp;#39;ll devour

The bearer of light
The primal tones
Take my flesh and let me go

The final march
The seventh step
The death of this dream has come

All I have loved
All I have held
Has led to this sea of one

All I have loved
All I have held
Has led to this song of souls

Send me up now
Send me up now
Send me up now
I&amp;#39;m ready for time to die
I&amp;#39;m ready for infinite eyes
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="metal"></category></entry><entry><title>The Genesis</title><link href="https://rivenlogik.github.io/the-genesis.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-01T22:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-08-01T22:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Rivenlogik</name></author><id>tag:rivenlogik.github.io,2017-08-01:/the-genesis.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Finding inspiration in metal and code&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;A creative outlet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was recently told this by someone I was watching typing away at some code.
I realized I have always been interested in coding but just never really took the time to improve the craft.
I also realized I didn't really have a creative outlet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am this evening, thinking to myself - go start a blog and make it your creative outlet.
Go take notes on that coding you've been learning.
Write about that band you've been listening to... the latest delicious beer.  So on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thoughts all culiminated into action recently while listening to this &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7O6Ozx95P8"&gt;Leprous&lt;/a&gt; live album.  I encourage everyone to have a listen.  It'll encompass about two hours of your life that you'll &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will transpire amongst these pages (in between random gaming relapses) is a dedicated stream of conciousness encompassing coding, cyber security, beer, and metal music through a filter of drunken rambling as I work to fight off procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the inspirational lyrics of &lt;em&gt;'Rewind'&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7O6Ozx95P8#t=17m45s"&gt;17:45&lt;/a&gt;
 of the video) by &lt;em&gt;Leprous&lt;/em&gt; - The circle (of procrastination) is ending for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Build up, tear down
Set free, rewind
Set free, rewind, rewind!

The circle is ending
I&amp;#39;m done pretending
Left behind

Resist to be reputed
Protect the undisputed
Behold your insufficiency wistfully

Behold your demolition
Assume there&amp;#39;s no ambition
None better suited

Build up, tear down
Set free, rewind
Set free, rewind, rewind!

The circle is ending
I&amp;#39;m done pretending
Left behind

I am hollow
None to follow
I am hollow
Rewind, Rewind!

The circle is ending
I&amp;#39;m done pretending
Left behind

The same logical notion
Conceal secret emotion

Behind resting devotion
Steadily in your ocean
In your ocean

Build up, tear down
Set free, rewind
Rewind, rewind!

The circle is ending
I&amp;#39;m done pretending
Left behind

Hopeful undistilled
Intention unfulfilled

Destroyed to justify
To wake up and to die
My quiet ruin

Build up, tear down
Set free, rewind
Rewind, rewind!

The circle is ending
I&amp;#39;m done pretending
Left behind

I am hollow
None to follow
I am hollow
NONE TO FOLLOW

SHATTER, FALL
NEVER FOUND AT ALL
YET SECRETLY TOLD TO REWIND

OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
THAT&amp;#39;S WHY, EVEN RUINS... DIE&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="metal"></category></entry></feed>
